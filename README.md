# DroneNetworkPathFinder

This was a assignment project for SOFTENG 364, a computer networks and security paper

# Implementation

For the project, we were required to implement distance vector routing algorithm. This algorithm required neighbour drones to send updates of shortest paths to other destination drones.
According to the information recieved, a forwarding table was generated we the shortest paths to each destination drone.

Within the code there is also an implementation of Dijsktras shortest path algorithm, however, this was not required for the assignment.


# Testing

testbed.jar can be used to test path finder.
commands can be found within the assignment brief.
